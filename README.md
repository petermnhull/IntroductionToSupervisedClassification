# Introduction to Supervised Classification

Exploration of a data set that contains rating information for cars in a used car dealership, with descriptor variables such as buying price and car features.

The models for supervised classification include:
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines
* Multi-Layer Perceptrons (Neural Networks)

Approaches for hyper-parameter tuning of the models include:
* Grid Search algorithms
* Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation
